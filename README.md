## Ratings and Reviews

This section will allow you to see reviews of the current product. You can sort the reviews by Relevance, Helpfulness, or Newness. You can also filter reviews by the number of stars given to the product by the reviewer. On the left side of the screen, there is a review breakdown which will show you the relative percentages of the reviews by star rating and what percentage of people recommend the product. You can also load more reviews into the module and add reviews.
