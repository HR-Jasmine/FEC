## Questions and Answers
The main components of the  questions and answer section consists of a search bar, a list of questions sorted by helpfulness and forms that allow users to ask new question and submit new answers about a specific product. The questions are formatted in an accordion which will collapse and expand to show answers related to each question. If users want to filter questions they can use the search bar to filter questions based on key words. 

## Ratings and Reviews

This section will allow you to see reviews of the current product. You can sort the reviews by Relevance, Helpfulness, or Newness. You can also filter reviews by the number of stars given to the product by the reviewer. On the left side of the screen, there is a review breakdown which will show you the relative percentages of the reviews by star rating and what percentage of people recommend the product. You can also load more reviews into the module and add reviews.
